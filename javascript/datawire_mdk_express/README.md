Datawire MDK integration for the Express.js web server.

The Datawire Microservices Development Kit is an open source SDK for building microservices. The MDK includes native APIs for [service discovery](https://www.datawire.io/guide/service-discovery-microservices/), resilience (including [circuit breakers](https://www.datawire.io/guide/circuit-breakers-microservices-properly-use-hystrix/) and [deadlines](https://www.datawire.io/guide/deadlines-distributed-timeouts-microservices/)), and distributed logging.

The MDK is *not* a platform; it is designed to augment your existing webapp framework. For more information, visit [https://www.datawire.io](https://www.datawire.io).
